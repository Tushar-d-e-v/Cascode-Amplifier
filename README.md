# Cascode-Amplifier
Design of beta multiplier, cascode amplifier and cascode current mirror in schematic and layout using LTspice and Magic for 180nm and 22nm technology 

The circuits for beta-multiplier and current mirror are made to get desired bias currents for cascode amplifier.
The calculations for the amplifier bias ranges are also shown in the summary report and the ranges from above calculation fits in the desired range.
The amplifier is designed for a 20V/V gainand power dissipation less than 20mW
The output simulations of amplifier can be viewed both in ltspice as well as ngspice through magic
